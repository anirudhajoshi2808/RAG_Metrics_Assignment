## Project Tasks
  
### Step 1: Initial Setup and API Integration
        
1. **API Key Management**: Securely manage the OpenAI API key using Streamlit secrets management.
2. **Environment Setup**: Ensure the project environment is properly configured with all necessary dependencies.

### Step 2: User Interaction

1. **User Input Handling**: Implement a chat interface allowing users to input their queries.

### Step 3: Processing and Responding to User Queries
    
1. **Query Processing**: Use OpenAI API to process user queries and generate appropriate responses.
2. **Response Display**: Display both user queries and bot responses in a chat-like interface within the Streamlit app.
3. **Maintaining Chat History**: Store and display the conversation history for seamless user interaction.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions

### Challenge 1: API Integration
**Issue**: Managing different versions and deprecations in the OpenAI and Pinecone APIs.  
**Solution**: Updated code to comply with the latest API versions and used the correct methods and classes for interaction.

### Challenge 2: Embedding Storage and Retrieval
**Issue**: Efficiently storing and retrieving embeddings in Pinecone for fast similarity searches.  
**Solution**: Properly configured Pinecone indexing and embedding processes, ensuring accurate and efficient data handling.

### Challenge 3: Query Processing
**Issue**: Ensuring the chatbot accurately understands and processes user queries.  
**Solution**: Utilized OpenAI's advanced language models to interpret user inputs accurately and generate relevant responses.

### Challenge 4: Handling Negative or Inappropriate Queries
**Issue**: The chatbot should handle negative or inappropriate queries gracefully.  
**Solution**: Implemented checks and filters to identify and reject inappropriate or out-of-context queries, maintaining the system's robustness.

## Generation Metrics

1. **Faithfulness**: The accuracy and reliability of the generated answers.
2. **Answer Relevance**: The relevance of the generated answers to the user's query.
3. **Information Integration**: The ability to integrate and present information cohesively.
4. **Negative Rejection**: The system's ability to reject and handle negative or inappropriate queries.

## Conclusion

By completing these tasks and overcoming the challenges faced, we have developed an interactive and engaging book recommendation chatbot. This system leverages OpenAI's capabilities to provide informative and accurate responses to user queries, ensuring a high-quality user experience.
